# CNN for Brain tumor classification

This Repository contains the code developed to implement a CNN to achieve brain tumor classification on MRI images. 
The project involves working with two different datasets from Kaggle, applying preprocessing techniques like cropping, contrast enhancement, and data augmentation, and optimizing the model through hyperparameter tuning (grid search and Bayesian search). The best-performing model achieves 97.7% testing accuracy on the improved dataset.
